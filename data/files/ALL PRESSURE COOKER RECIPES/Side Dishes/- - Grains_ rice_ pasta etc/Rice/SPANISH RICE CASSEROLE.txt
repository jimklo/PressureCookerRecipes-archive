BASIC BROWN RICE IN THE PRESSURE COOKER

1 cup brown rice
1 3/4 cups water
1 tablespoon butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste

Combine rice, water, butter, and salt in pressure
cooker and stir well. Cover pressure cooker and bring
up to full pressure (15 pounds). Reduce heat to the
lowest setting that will maintain full pressure and
cook for 18 minutes. Release pressure under cold water
and test rice. If the rice is not tender, add additional
liquid if necessary, replace the cover, and cook longer -
up to 25 minutes total cooking time. When rice is 
properly cooked, release pressure and unlock cover. Let
stand 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and serve immediately.
