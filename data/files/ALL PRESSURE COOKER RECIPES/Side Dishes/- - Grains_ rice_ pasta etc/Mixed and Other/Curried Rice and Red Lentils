Curried Rice and Red Lentils

(4-6 servings, adapted from The Best Recipes in the World, by Mark Bittman)

2 T vegetable oil
1 large onion, chopped
1 T curry powder (I used more, we can't get enough spice here!)
3/4 cup red lentils (also called dal or pulses)
1 cup long grain rice
3 cups water
salt, pepper to taste
1-2 T melted butter
chopped parsley or cilantro, for garnish (optional)


Put the oil in a large, heavy pan with a tight lid and heat for one minute. Add 
onion and sauté 3-5 minutes, until starting to brown on the edges. Add curry 
powder and sauté 1 minute, then add water and bring to a boil. Add lentils and 
rice, bring back to a boil, then lower heat to a steady simmer and cover.

Cook 20 minutes, or until lentils are tender. (Bittman says if the liquid is not
all absorbed, boil off the excess, but after 20 minutes all my water had been 
absorbed.) Season with salt and pepper, then stir in the melted butter just 
before serving. Garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro if desired.
