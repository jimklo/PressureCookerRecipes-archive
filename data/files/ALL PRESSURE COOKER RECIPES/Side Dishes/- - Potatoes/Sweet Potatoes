Just ran across this recipe in one of my old recipe boxes. It came
from a 1950s Better Homes and Gardens Cook Book. I made it often in
my stove top Mirro Matic PC, it was delicious. Have yet to try it in
my electric PCs.

Place in pressure pan 1/3 cup water, 1+1/2 teaspoons salt, 4 cups
diced potatoes, and 1/3 cup finely diced onion.

Cover; bring to 15 pounds pressure. Immediately remove from heat and
let pressure go down normally. Add 1/2 cup light cream. Snip parsley
over. Makes 6 servings.
