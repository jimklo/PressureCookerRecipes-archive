PLEASE NOTE SOME OF THESE RECIPES MAY NOT HAVE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF LIQUIDS FOR 
PRESSURE COOKING!!! PLEASE CONSULT YOUR MANUAL TO DETERMINE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF
MOISTURE THAT IS NEEDED FOR YOUR PRESSURE COOKER!

THE RECIPE FOR CHICKEN AND MUSHROOMS AND THE RECIPE FOR CHICKEN & PEPPERS DO NOT
HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE!! I WILL BE ADJUSTING THESE RECIPES AND REPOST THEM AT A 
LATER DATE!


DISCLAIMER!!

Everyone using these recipes should use them in their pressure cooker according 
to their own cooker’s directions. Some of these recipes have the “cold water” 
method to release pressure. DO NOT USE THIS METHOD WITH ELECTRIC PC’S!!

Everyone using these recipes is responsible for their own safety. I take no 
responsibility or liability if there are problems or mishaps. I am only sharing

MAIN DISHES

BEEF

3 Envelope Roast

 3 pound or so roast (beef or pork) such as chuck roast
 1 envelope of dry Italian salad dressing mix
 1 envelope of dry ranch salad dressing mix
 1 envelope of dry brown gravy mix
 Water or other liquids - for a pressure cooker 2 cups of water, broth or wine or combination,  (for slow cooker 1 cup water in a  slow cooker.)

(Please note in a SLOW COOKER you CAN cut in half the dry ingredients if you 
find it overpowering.)

In the pressure cooker use the whole envelopes. I prefer the whole envelopes in 
either method of cooking.

Put the water in a measuring cup that is larger then the amount of water you are
using. Now add and mix all three envelopes of dry salad dressings to the water. 
Mix until blended completely. 

Brown the roast (if desired) I love mine browned in the CE 8 qt PC)
Add the meat to your cooker
Pour the water, salad dressing mixture over the roast 
Now cook as usual. In the CE Pressure Cooker, I cooked it for 70 minutes and 
used quick release method can and probably should use natural but I am always in
a hurry when making this as it smells so good! In the slow cooker cook it on 
high for about 4 hours on low about 8 hours.

You can use the liquid for gravy or broth!

Beef and Peppers 

I've had my pressure cooker for years and I just love it! My family of 4 loves 
my roast beef with carrots and potatoes. First, you brown the meat with a little
bit of oil (inside of the pressure cooker), then you drain the oil. I have a 
rack that has holes that came with mine. (it's old) Put the meat on top of this 
plate (if you don't have one, no big deal) and pour water half way up the side 
of the meat. Season to taste. After it starts to jingle cook the meat for 1 
hour. After the hour is up, put your potatoes and carrots in. I use fresh 
carrots. After it starts to jingle again, cook it for another 10-15 minutes. And
then enjoy! Also, I do stuffed green peppers. Here is the recipe for this.

large green peppers
 1/2 - 1 lb. ground beef (or ground turkey)
 1 tbsp... chopped onion
 1 cup dry bread crumbs (1-1/2 to 2 cups with ground turkey)
 1 egg
 1 tsp. salt
 1/4 tsp. pepper
 1 (8 oz.) can tomato sauce
 1 can tomatoes (cut, whole - large can)
 1 small can tomato puree

Take the core out of the green peppers and wash out the seeds. Mix together all 
the ingredients except for the tomato sauce, tomatoes and tomato puree. Stuff 
the mix in the green peppers. Place them into the cooker standing up. If you 
have the rack with the holes, place it in the cooker first. Then start adding 
all the tomato ingredients around the stuffed peppers. Add 3 cups of water after
the tomato ingredients are in. The water should be 1/2 way up the peppers. Then 
just wait for the jingle and let cook for only 20 minutes.

Ribs

15-30 min for ribs with bbq sauce, that was from the presentation on qvc.

Prep time: 15 minutes Pressure cooking time: 20-25 minutes @ 15 lbs..
Marinate time: 30 min. Grill time: Just until glazed (optional)
If you love baby back ribs but are skeptical about the success of preparing them
on only a grill, and for those who want to spend less time cooking and more time
relaxing with family and friends, try an Uncle Randawg's shortcut:

5-g qt. pressure cooker filled 1/4 deep with water
6 slabs of baby back ribs cut into serving pieces (about 3-4 ribs each)
No Seasoning
3-4 18 oz. jars of Uncle Randawg's BBQ Sauce (Hot & Spicy or Mild & Spicy or a 
mix of each)
Add cut baby back ribs to pressure cooker (no seasoning) and lock the lid in 
place. cook at 15 lbs.. (im thinking high pressure) for 20-25 minutes. The ribs 
are done if the meat can be easily separated from the bone when poked with a 
fork.

Old-Fashioned Pot Roast

Producing a fork-tender, melt-in-the-mouth roast in less than an hour is still 
one of the pressure cooker's most dramatic feats. 

Serves: 6

 1 beef chuck or round roast, about 3 1/4-pounds, trimmed of excess fat 
 2 to 4 cloves garlic, thinly sliced (optional) 
 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 
 salt 
 ground black pepper 
 1 cup finely chopped onion 
 1/2 cup finely chopped carrot 
 1/2 cup finely chopped celery 
 1/2 cup finely chopped parsnip or turnip 
 2-1/2 cups homemade or canned beef stock or bouillon 
 2 bay leaves 
 1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves 
 1-1/2 pounds medium-size red potatoes, scrubbed and quartered 
 3 medium-size parsnips, peeled and cut into 3 or 4 chunks 
 2 tablespoons all purpose flour mashed into 2 tablespoons softened unsalted butter 
 Fresh thyme leaves (optional) 

If desired, make 3/4-inch-deep, evenly distributed incisions in roast and push 
one slice of garlic into each.

In 6-quart pressure cooker, heat 3 tablespoons oil over high heat. Add meat and 
brown well on all sides lifting meat frequently with spatula to prevent sticking
— about 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add extra oil as needed. Season each browned 
side with salt and pepper, be conservative if you're using canned stock or 
bouillon. Remove meat to platter and set aside.

In blackened oil remaining in cooker, sauté the chopped onion, carrot, celery, 
and parsnip for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally, scrape any browned bits from 
bottom of cooker. Add beef stock, bay leaves, and dried thyme.

Set rack or trivet in cooker and place meat on it, broad side down, so that as 
much surface as possible submerges.

Lock lid into place, heat to high pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to just 
enough to maintain high pressure and cook 60 minutes. Let pressure drop 
naturally for 15 minutes (see " Releasing Pressure"). Remove lid, opening it 
away from you, to allow any remaining steam to escape.

When pot roast is done, it should be easy to pierce with a fork. If it is not 
sufficiently tender, lock lid back in place and heat to high pressure for 
another 5 minutes, let pressure drop naturally.

When roast is fork-tender, transfer to platter, set aside in warm place. Remove 
rack from cooker. Place potatoes, whole onions, and parsnip chunks in cooker. 
Lock lid into place and return to high pressure over high heat. Reduce heat to 
just enough to maintain high pressure and cook 5 minutes.

Meanwhile, slice meat. Reduce pressure in cooker using quick-release (see " 
Releasing Pressure"). Remove lid, opening it away from you, to allow any 
remaining steam to escape. With slotted spoon, transfer vegetables to platter 
around meat, set aside in warm place.

 Over high heat, gradually whisk flour-butter mixture into liquid in cooker. 
Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens 3 to 4 minutes. Remove bay 
leaves and season to taste. Pour gravy over meat and vegetables on platter, 
sprinkle with fresh thyme, if desired, and serve immediately.

 1 tablespoon brown sugar 
 1 (14-1/2-ounce) can stewed tomatoes 
 1/3 cup water 
 3 tablespoons yellow mustard 
 2 tablespoons Worcestershire sauce 
 12 Kaiser rolls, split and toasted 

In a 4- or 6-quart pressure cooker cook ground beef, onion, sweet pepper, and 
garlic over medium heat until meat is browned. 

Add the oats, brown sugar, undrained tomatoes, water, mustard, and
Worcestershire sauce. 

Lock lid in place. Place pressure regulator on vent pipe (if you have a 
first-generation cooker). Over high heat, bring cooker up to pressure. Reduce 
heat just enough to maintain pressure and pressure regulator rocks gently; cook 
for 8 minutes. 

Quick-release the pressure. Carefully remove lid. For a thicker consistency, 
return to boiling and simmer, uncovered, until thickened. 

Spoon 1/2 cup of the ground beef mixture onto each roll. 

Makes 12 servings (6 cups of meat). 

Make-Ahead Tip: Cool meat mixture. Cover and chill up to 24 hours. Reheat in 
saucepan on range top, stirring frequently. Toast rolls and serve as above.

Chicken Noodle Soup 1

I had left over chicken from last night and this is what I made for lunch today.
I made it in the cook's essential electric p/c, but the theory should be the
same in any p/c.

I tore the left over chicken off of the bone and browned it along with onion  in
a tbsp. or so of olive oil.
Added 6 or so cups of water (did it by sight) and 5 chicken bouillon cubes,
sliced carrots and celery, and a little pepper.
I cooked this on high pressure for 4 minutes. Released the pressure and added
two really large handfuls of wide egg noodles.  I brought it back up to pressure
for 1. My timer only has whole numbers so I let it go to pressure for 1 and
waited about another 1 and 1/2 minutes before releasing the pressure.

This was great chicken noodle soup. My whole family loved it. And so simple
and quick.

French Onion Soup 2

Some onion soups are short on onions and flavor, but not this one! Excluding the
bread and cheese, there are only six ingredients in this soup, but what 
ingredients they are: flavorful olive oil, sweet onions, pungent garlic (both 
onions and garlic are members of the allium family) enticing thyme, mellow dry 
sherry, and rich beef broth stock! When combined, they make the best onion soup,
especially when topped with crisp bread croutons and melted cheese. 

Preparation Time: 15 Minutes 
Cooking Time: 6 Minutes Under Pressure 
Pressure Setting: High

 1 1/2 cups of 3/4 inch square French bread cubes
 4 tbsp. olive oil; halved
 6 cups thinly sliced Spanish or Vidalia onions 
 4 cloves garlic, sliced very thin 
 1 tbsp. dried thyme 
 1/2 cup dry sherry or white vermouth
 4 cups beef stock or broth
 salt and pepper to taste 
 1 cup grated Gruyere or Swiss cheese

Serves 4 to 6

Preheat the oven to 350° F. Toss the bread cubes in a large bowl with 2 tbsp. of
the olive oil. Place on a baking sheet and toast in the oven for 15 minutes, or 
until crisp, shaking periodically. Set aside to cool.

Heat the remaining 2 tbsp. olive oil in the pressure cooker over medium-high 
heat. Add the onions and garlic. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the thyme, dry sherry, 
and 2 cups of stock.

Cover and bring to high pressure over high heat. Lower the heat to stabilize the
 pressure. Cook for 6 minutes.

Remove from the heat. Let the pressure release by using the quick release 
method. Unlock and remove the pressure cooker cover.

Preheat the broiler. Add the remaining 2 cups of stock and bring to a simmer. 
Season with salt and pepper.

Ladle the soup into heatproof bowls. Float some bread cubes on top and sprinkle 
with the grated cheese. Place the soup bowls on a baking pan and set under the 
broiler until the cheese melts and is bubbly, about 1 to 3 minutes, depending on
your broiler.

Cream of Garden Tomato Soup 

 1 hour  30 min prep 

 1 tbsp. vegetable oil 
 1 tbsp. butter  
 1 large yellow onion  finely chopped (you can also use a white onion)
 3 lbs. tomatoes coarsely chopped
 2 teaspoons fresh thyme chopped (or 1 teaspoon dried)
 1 teaspoon salt
 1/4 teaspoon black pepper freshly ground
 1/2 cup chicken broth (or vegetable broth or water)
 3/4 cup heavy cream  

Heat the oil and butter in the pressure cooker over medium high heat until the 
butter melts. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until wilted, about
5 minutes.
Add the tomatoes and their juices, thyme, salt, pepper, and broth and stir to 
mix.
Lock on the lid and bring to pressure over high heat, about 4 minutes.
Reduce heat to medium and cook for 15 minutes.
Remove from the heat and let sit for 10 minutes to finish cooking (this step 
also lets the cooker cool down so that the later release of steam is minimal).
With the steam vent pointed away from your face, gently release any remaining 
pressure. Let cool enough to remove lid.
Use immersion blender to puree soup (or transfer soup to blender or food 
processor and puree in smaller batches to avoid burning yourself).
If after blending you see any chunks of tomato peel, put soup through strainer 
or food mill to remove.
If using right away, place soup in large pan and stir in cream. Reheat gently 
without boiling then add garnish of choice and serve.
If not using right away, store in the refrigerator until ready to use; then stir
in the cream, heat and serve.

This recipe has two of the 'foaming' ingredients, lentils and barley. But 
because this is a soup, there is so much liquid that the ingredients just won't 
foam enough to cause problems. Remember to thoroughly clean the pressure cooker,
especially the valves and gaskets, after making this recipe.

2 tbsp. olive oil
1/2 lb. bulk Italian sausage
1 onion, chopped
1/2 cup pearl barley
3 cloves garlic, minced
12 cups chicken stock
1 cup lentils, sorted and rinsed
1 boneless, skinless chicken breast
9 oz. pkg. frozen spinach, thawed and drained
1 cup salsa

Place 1 tbsp. olive oil in cooker; heat using brown function or heating over 
medium high heat. Cook sausage, drain, and set aside. Add remaining 1 tbsp. 
olive oil to pressure cooker and saute onion and garlic for 2 minutes, stirring 
frequently. Add barley and saute one minute longer. Add browned sausage, 
lentils, uncooked chicken breast, then add enough chicken stock to cover 
ingredients in cooker. Close lid, bring to high pressure then cook for 9 
minutes. Remove from heat and release pressure naturally, with quick-release 
valve or cold-water method for old-fashioned cookers. Open cooker lid. Remove 
chicken, shred meat and return to cooker. Add remaining chicken stock, beans, 
thawed spinach and salsa to soup mixture, close lid, bring to high pressure, and
cook for 2 minutes. Reduce pressure, remove lid, and serve. 6-8 servings

MISCELLANEOUS INFORMATION

One important point to keep in mind when converting conventional recipes to 
cooking in a pressure cooker:

 always be sure to include the correct amount of liquid needed for your 
particular cooker - no matter what the recipe calls for; sufficient liquid is 
needed to build up the steam/pressure for safe cooking in a pressure cooker.

~~~~~~~~
 Be sure to get a piece of meat that is fairly well marbled. Chuck works well. 
The PC breaks down the fat and connective tissue really well. Brown the meat 
darkly in the pot before adding the water or putting on the lid.

 Then put in the stuff that you usually would in a pot roast: onions, carrots, 
celery, bay leaf (I like to add rutabaga). Put on the lid and bring up to 
pressure. Lower the heat to as low as will keep the steam escaping, or the 
weight wobbling, and cook it for 45 to 50 minutes. Cool the pot quickly, open 
it, and test the meat to see if it's as done as you like it; if not, then put it
back on the heat for a bit longer.

 There's nothing magic here. You just have to get used to the times, and to
 the fact that you can't see what's going on inside.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~ 

Now what I meant by doing the thirds is the fact that 99% of the recipes you run
into are for more traditional types of cooking, You know, stove top,
 oven, broasting etc. Should you like to convert one of those recipes
 to cook in a pressure cooker, you can by reducing the given cooking time to one
 third.
 Like if you boil something an hour, pressure cook it for 20 minutes. I hope 
this clears up my meaning a bit.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Use more if you choose, but never less water than called for when adapting your 
own recipes.  Always add 1 cup or more liquid to roasts after browning and cover
cooker at once called for in any recipe.

Liquids other than water constitute part of liquid necessary and should be 
deducted from total liquid called for in any recipe.

When you choose to use rack always add 1/4 cup more liquid than called for.


Always reduce heat when regulator (or control) begins to jiggle or rock.  It 
should move 1 to 4 times to produce desired finished product. Use low or medium 
setting on electric range to maintain this pressure, or simmer on gas range.

During the course of steaming if you notice a sight leakage around air vent or 
pipe, this is natural. But if this persists, examine automatic air vent to see 
if food has collected there or is some part of cooker needs to be tightened.

Leakage between cover and body suggest sealing ring or gasket is not in place or
 needs to be replaced.

Realize that all cooking times specified can only be approximate. Conditions of 
ingredients use, size of fresh produce varies, pressure of home gas or 
electricity varies and certain other uncontrollable variations. So know your own
 cooker and range condition.

When adapting your own recipes for dishes that are to be cooked in a mold or 
casserole covered with double fold of heavy foil be sure to increase cooking 
time.  To secure foil, crimp edges tightly to seal. As and added precaution, tie
 with string.

Two methods of reducing pressure instantly may be used-cooling cooker under COLD
running water or setting cooker in pan of cold water. The first method is 
faster.

When reducing pressure by placing cooker under cold running water take care not 
to let water get into cooker through steam vent.

When you want to cook 2 or more vegetables at the same time, it is not necessary
 to place in separate containers as flavors will not mingle. Don't use high heat
 to bring up pressure when cooking, cereals, pastas, rice, dried vegetables or 
other foods that are apt to froth while cooking. Always add 1 tablespoon oil to 
counteract froth, and bring pressure up slowly.

When you want to drain liquid from cooked food remove gasket from cover, and let
 liquid drain through "apertures."

Never substitute oil for required amount of liquid in any recipe.

Always consult manufacturer's handbook for specific information about your 
particular cooker.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Range-top recipes can be adapted for pressure cooker if most of the ingredients 
are put into the cooker at the start.  Because the success of cooking under 
pressure relies on the correct amount of liquid you need and the approximate 
cooking time.

IF YOUR RECIPE CALLS: Soup stock, tomatoes, juice, etc, this should be

considered as a substitute for an equal amount of water.  HOWEVER, do not use 
milk because it has a tendency to boil over and scorch.

DO NOT PREPARE: Applesauce, rhubarb, cranberries, pearl barley, split peas or 
pea soup in the pressure cooker. ( I do cook barley, split peas or peas if they 
are mixed with OTHER FOODS).

SOUPS: Your pressure cooker will cook soups in a matter of minutes instead of 
hours.  DO NOT FILL pan more then 3/4 full of liquid. Cook the soup stock from 
bones and meat first; reduce pressure; then add other ingredients. (I use all my
leftovers meats IF there is any left). Add the ingredients, (vegetables, 
noodles, etc.) as desired and finish cooking. (IF I use leftover meats, I omit 
the first part
and cook the all ingredients at the same time).  After soup is cooked may be 
skimmed off and add more water may be added, especially if soup stock is very 
rich.

USE MOLDS IN DESSERT PREPARATION:  Preparation of steamed puddings and custards 
requires the use of molds.  The individual custard cups are standard size.  For 
large puddings and bread recipes, a one-quart mold or bowl may be used.  
Suitable bowls may  purchased from pressure cooker dealer.  Copper-tone molds 
can be used in the pressure cooker. Aluminum foil makes an excellent cover for 
any mold. In addition to using them for desserts, you will find molds very handy
for warming leftover such as creamed combinations, casserole foods, etc., which 
usually present a problem because they tend to

stick to saucepans when reheated. (Cookbook is before the days of microwave;-). 
Just place the mold of food on the rack in the pressure cooker over 1 cup water,
set the control of 15 pounds and when it jiggles, remove from heat and let 
pressure drop normally.

HINT: One teaspoon of vinegar or 1/2 teaspoon cream of tarter put in the water 
in the pressure cooker when steaming is done helps to prevent water stains.  
(Didn't know that either.)

HINT: Cooking oil tends to keep foods that foam at safe level during cooking 
such as dried vegetables (beans is what we're talking about here) that tends 
foam, forth and sputter.  By adding oil it keeps foam as safe and desirable 
level. (I didn't know that about using oil, never have used it. INTERESTING!). 
 When cooking dried vegetables do not fill cooker over one-half full!!!


FROZEN VEGETABLES:  Frozen vegetables should not be thawed before
pressure cooking.  The only exception to this rule is corn on the cob
which must be completely defrosted.  Bread the block of frozen vegetables apart 
into smaller pieces to assure uniform cooking this is easily done with the hands
except for spinach which must be cut into about 1" pieces. One-half water is 
sufficient for cooking any quantity of frozen vegetable because the cooking time
 is so very short. Time for cooking carefully so that vegetables will not be
overcooked and reduce pressure instantly.

FRUITS:  Fresh fruits cook very quickly.  Apricots, cherries, peaches, and plums
are brought to pressure to 0 pressure, then reduce pressure normally. Pears are 
cooked 2 minutes, then reduce normally. Pineapple takes 6 minutes then reduce 
normally.  Sugar to taste should be added to the fruit AFTER it is cooked--about
1 cup per quart of cherries or plums; 1/2 cup per 2 lbs of apricot, peaches or 
pears.

USE HIGHER PRESSURE AT HIGH ALTITUDE:  At altitudes of 2,000 feet or
higher, use 10 lbs. pressure if chart or recipe indicates 5 lbs; use 15 lbs. if 
10 is shown and increase cooking time slightly if 15 lbs. is called for.  This 
applies to canning as well as cooking.

NUTRITION FACTS: Cooking under pressure generally requires less fat
the other cooking methods.  Also pressure-cooked foods are so flavorful they 
require LESS salt.

STEAMER: Pressure cooker as a steamer is idea because the heat is constant. 
Generally, STEAMED BREADS AND PUDDINGS REQUIRE A STEAMING

PERIOD FOR LEAVENING ACTION BEFORE PLACING THE PRESSURE REGULATOR ON THE VENT 
for about 5 minutes such as bread puddings.  Any type of mold (metal, glass, 
earthenware and tin cans, etc.) which will fit

loosely into the pressure cooker may be used.  In the event a mold without a 
cover is used (this type is recommended), waxed paper, parchment paper, or 
aluminum foil should be tied or fastened over the top of the container.

Once you have become a skilled in the use of your pressure cooker, you will want
to adapt some of your own favorite recipes to pressure cooking. Spending a few 
minutes in converting a pet recipe will pay dividends in time saved as you use 
the recipe over and over.  Recipes for soups, poultry, seafood, vegetables and 
many combination foods can easily be adapted to pressure cooking.  Here are the 
three important things to determine and check.

1. AMOUNT OF LIQUID: Use comparable recipes in this book as your guide. In
general, when preparing soups and braised meats, the amount of water can be 
reduced form the traditional recipe because it allows for water evaporation
during the long cooking. Therefore, vegetables and mixtures including
vegetables may need only small amounts of water. At least 1/2 cup water is 
always add to the cooker for the production of steam.

2. COOKING TIME. The length of time that a food should pressure cooked
is usually 1/3 (one-third) of the cooking time given in your recipe. Do not 
start counting time until 15 lb pressure has been reached and you lowered heat 
for cooking.

3. METHOD OF COOLING THE COOKER.
Whether you should cool the cooker immediately or let pressure drop of its own 
accord depends on the type of food being prepared. Again, checking a similar 
recipe in this book is helpful. In general, large solid pieces of meat, like 
roasts, should continue to cook while pressure drops by itself. For other foods,
the cooker can be cooled right away and food served immediately.  Use the rack 
is another thing to decide upon in adapting personal recipes to the pressure
cooker. When you want to blending of flavors during cooking, place food in the 
cooking liquid (water, broth, beer, etc.). When you wish to cook foods such as 
roasts out of the liquid, place them on rack, above the liquid. Some cooks like 
a crisper exterior on their meats then is usually produced by the pressure 
cooker. For a crisp outside, just broil meat a minute or two after removing from
the cooker. In a high altitude areas, cooking time should be increased 5% for 
every 1000 feet about the first 2000 feet.

 ~ ~ ~ ~ 

My suggest is that you use your imagination. Throw in a ham, pineapples, some 
brown sugar and you've got dinner. Put in a whole chicken stuffed with 
seasoning. Eat the chicken one night and save everything else for soup the next.
You have the broth and the extra chicken. All you need to add is noodles or 
dumplings.

Try a pot roast with carrots, onions, mushroom, and potatoes. A great dinner 
that looks like you slaved for hours. Or try stew meat, onions, potatoes, 
mushrooms, etc. and you've got beef stew.

~ ~ ~ ~ ~

Try Casserole Recipes: Get out your old casserole cook books and go for your 
life! I find that most of my old favorites work just as well in the pressure 
cooker (usually better!) with a couple of minor adjustments to the 
water/moisture content. Depending on the pressure cooker, you can usually do 
your browning or braising in them as well - I like to get inexpensive lamb chops
on sale at the supermarket, brown them in the pressure cooker with a little 
sprayed on oil and some sliced onion, then I add whatever I have in the way of 
extra vegetables, a little stock/water/wine and cook for 15 minutes (once it's 
steaming). It's quick enough to have on the table in less than 30 minutes after 
we get home from work.

My quickest soup recipe is 1.25 cups of lentils/split peas, 5 cups of beef 
stock, one onion chopped, and a tin of chopped or crushed tomatoes (whichever 
was on special!) with my favorite dried herbs. It takes about 30 minutes 
(depending on the dried pulse you use - less for red lentils and split peas, 
longer for brown lentils) and can then be blended if you like a finer soup or 
served with big chunks. It's thick enough to make a weekend family lunch with 
bread or garlic bread and the almost total lack of preparation makes it very 
simple to make!

Beef, Pork and Chicken: I use a pressure cooker during the winter months. It 
makes great "comfort food" meals. If you season your meat to your liking you get
tender meat with good gravy in a short amount of time. The three meals that I 
make the most are basic round steak, chicken, and pork steak. ( also I found 
that I had to go heavy- handed with the spices I like or the food was too 
bland.)

For the Round Steak, I cut the meat into portion sizes. I season with fresh 
ground black pepper, paprika, seasoned salt, marjoram and thyme. Using a small 
amount of oil, I brown the meat well on both sides, throwing in some chopped 
onion with each batch of meat. Then I add enough water to cover the meat with a 
teaspoon of beef bouillon for each cup of water. Cook according to the 
directions of the pressure cooker, or 12-15 minutes after the weight starts to 
gently rock. I do the quick cool down under cold water. Remove meat and thicken 
the gravy with either flour & water paste or cornstarch and water paste. I serve
with mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli or carrots.

Pork Steaks are basically the same but I adjust my seasonings (leave out 
seasoned salt and add parsley) and cover with chicken broth, and since they cook
up in about 10 - 12 minutes or so, I add peeled carrots to the pot with the 
browned meat. I serve with noodles or rice.

For the chicken I use boneless skinless breasts that I season with parsley and 
black pepper and maybe a little garlic powder. But I don't brown the meat. I 
just cover with chicken broth and add whole carrots and celery and cook for

rice.
