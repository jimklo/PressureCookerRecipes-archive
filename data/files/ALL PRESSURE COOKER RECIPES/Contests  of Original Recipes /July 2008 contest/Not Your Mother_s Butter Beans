Austrian Style Sauerkraut

Joni Boggis	Orlando, Florida

Made in 8qt stainless steel Fagor stovetop pressure cooker

I have been trying to recreate the sauerkraut that I had in Austria a few years 
ago. This is the closest that I have come to that deep rich flavor that I 
enjoyed so very much. I am new to pressure cooking and so thought I would try 
making it in the pressure cooker this weekend. It came out the best so far.

1 bag sauerkraut, rinsed
1 lb. cooked pork butt, leftover from crockpot, cut into small 
pieces (can use more or less pork, depending on what you have leftover)
Fat and jelly from chilled pork butt
1 large jar natural applesauce (approximately 25 ounces)
4 medium russet potatoes, peeled and diced
1 large onion, chopped
10 juniper berries (optional)
1/2 cup dark brown sugar
1/2 cup water
Salt and pepper to taste
Any kind of würst (bratwürst, smoked sausage, knockwürst, etc.), 
sautéed and browned, cut into approximately 1 to 2 inch pieces


1.Put the chilled pork fat in stainless steel pressure cooker over medium high heat. 

2.Add potatoes, let caramelize slightly. 

3.Add onions, stir and let cook 2 minutes. 

4.Add drained and rinsed sauerkraut, stir together.

5.Add applesauce, salt, pepper, pork, pork jelly, juniper berries, brown sugar, 
and water. 

6.Clamp on and lock pressure cooker lid. 

7.Bring pressure cooker to pressure and lower heat to medium low to maintain 
pressure. 

8.Set timer for 10 minutes. 

9.Use quick release.
 
10.Add the würsts added in at the last. 

Enjoy!
