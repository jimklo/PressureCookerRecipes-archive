Broccoli soup with Lentils and 

We are experiencing a growth spurt of fall-winter veggies, mostly too much broccoli, mustard greens, bok choy and Japanese turnips.   We had to cut off the center heads of broccoli or lose the side shoot crop in coming months.  I love cream of broccoli soup but would prefer to make it without cream or refined thickeners.  So just on a whim I tried it with lentils as the thickener.  Just a small test to see if I wanted to make a big batch for freezing.  Hubs says it is a winner, me to.  

Ratio of red l entils to stock 1:5    (we have several pounds of red lentils that are extra quick cooking (15 minutes stove top) or "soft" so maybe the cooking time should be adjusted depending on the lentils used)

Saute onions, garlic in non-aromatic oil or ghee
Add lentils and mustard seed, briefly saute
Add cut up broccoli head stems and sweat
Add stock and any desired spices (I added a small amount of chopped smoked sausage for added flav or)
Lock lid and pressure cook for 10 minutes
Puree the contents with an immersion or standard blender
Return to the inner pot if standard blender used
Add broccoli florets and any fragile spices ( I used Penzey's Country French mix, Fox Point would be good too I think)
Lock lid and pressure cook low for 2 minutes
Serve with chopped chives.

for 4 servings

1 small onion or two shallots
1 clove garlic
1 cup red lentils
1/2 Tbs whole mustard seeds
1 lb broccoli, approx   Cut up the stems and maybe some florets for the first stage, saving some florets for the second stage.
1/4 lb smoked sausage, optional
5 cups stock 
Favorite spices as needed
