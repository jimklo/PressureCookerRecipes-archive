Milk and milk products will separate under the high heat of pressure
cooking. Best way to make any gravy is AFTER the meat has cooked.
Remove the meat and as much fat as possible from the remaining
broth.  Mix 2T cornstarch in 1-2 cups milk (or water)and slowly add
to the simmering broth.  Stir as it thickens but don't boil.  This is
foolproof gravy, without no lumps, lower in fat and carbs too.
