-------- ------------ --------------------------------
2 small fennel bulbs -- about 1-1/4 pounds total
1 med onion -- about 6 ounces
1 med red potato
1 stalk celery
1 large clove garlic
3 tablespoons unsalted butter
1/4 pounds sea scallops
1 cup fish stock -- or clam juice
1 cup water
1/4 cup dry white wine -- (if I don't have I just leave out)
Salt and Pepper to taste
Nutmeg freshly ground
Bermuda Hot Pepper sauce -- (opt)

Trim the long stalks from the fennel down to the bulb. Peel the outside of
the bulb, remove the core, and cut the bulb into thin slices. Cut the onion and
potato into thin slices too. Remove the strings from the celery and cut into
thin slices. Mince the garlic.

Melt the butter in the pressure cooker. Add the fennel, onion, potato, celery
and garlic and cook over med-Hi heat, stirring often, until soft about 7
minutes.

Rinse and drain the scallops. Add them, fish stock or clam juice and water
and wine to the pressure cooker. Cover and bring up to full pressure then reduce
heat to stabilize pressure. Cook for 10 minutes and release pressure.

Puree with a hand held blender or food processor. Add salt, pepper and nutmeg
to taste. If a richer soup is wanted, you can add 1/4 cup of whipping cream .

Can be made the day before. Reheat gently, without letting soup come to a
boil.
