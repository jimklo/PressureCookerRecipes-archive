  *remove the casings of the garlic sausage, if necessary.  If the =
sausage is thick, cut the slices into 2-3 pieces.

*Long-grain brown rice can also be used in this recipe.

Heat the oil in the cooker.  Saute the garlic and onion for 3 minutes.  =
Push the onions aside, and brown the sausage slices about 30 seconds on =
eah side.  Stir in the rice, coating the grains with the fat.  Add the =
ham, celery, green pepper, water, bay leaf, tomato paste, and salt and =
Tabasco to taste.

Lock the lid in place and over high heat bring to high pressure.  Adjust =
the heat to maintain high pressure and cook for 15 minutes.  Let the =
pressure drop naturally for 10 minutes, then quick release any remaining =
pressure.  Remove the lid, tilting it away from you to allow any excess =
steam to escape.

If the rice is slightly undercooked, cover and simmer over low heat for =
another 2 to 3 minutes; stir in a few tablespoons of water if the =
mixture is dry.  Stir int he coriander, adjust seasonings, and serve.
