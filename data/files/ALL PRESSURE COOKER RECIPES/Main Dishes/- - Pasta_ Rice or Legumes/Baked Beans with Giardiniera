Spicy Black-eyes and Beans with Rice

1/3 cup black-eyed peas, soaked overnight
1/3 cup black beans, soaked overnight
8 to 10 oz andouille sausage, diced (any spicy sausage will work)
1 sm onion, chopped
2 celery ribs, chopped
1 tsp dried thyme
2/3 cup converted white rice
1 can (10 oz) diced tomatoes with chiles
2 1/2  cups water
Salt and pepper
Chopped fresh cilantro (optional)

Put the sausage in the pressure cooker and cook over medium heat
until it begins to brown and render some fat. Add the onion, celery,
and thyme.  Cook uncovered until onion begins to soften, about 4
min.  Add the drained peas and beans, the rice, tomatoes with their
liquid, and water.
Cover and bring up to high pressure.  Reduce heat to stabilize
pressure and cook 12 min.  Release pressure by running cold water
over the cover. Season with salt and pepper to taste and sprinkle
with chopped cilantro.
