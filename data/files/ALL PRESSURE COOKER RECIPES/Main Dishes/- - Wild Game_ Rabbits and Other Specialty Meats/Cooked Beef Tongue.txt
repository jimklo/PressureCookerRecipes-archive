Here is a recipe for cooking rabbit from my Grandmother's old presto pressure
cooker instruction book. I would think you could just add whatever vegetables
go in it.
1 dressed rabbit (I wonder if that's casual or formal)
2 cups vinegar
3 cups water
1/2 cup sugar
1 slice onion
2 tsp. salt
1/2 tsp pepper
1 tsp pickling spice
1/4 cup fat
2 tbsp flour
Method: Cut rabbit into serving pieces. Combine vinegar, water, sugar, onion,
salt, pepper and pickling spice and pour over rabbit. Let stand in
refrigerator for 36 to 48 hours. Remove rabbit and wipe dry. Heat Cooker and
add fat. Sear rabbit in hot fat until golden brown. Gradually add 1 cup of
pickling liquid. Place cover on Cooker. Allow steam to flow from vent pipe to
release all air from Cooker. Place indicator weight on vent pipe and cook 15
minutes with stem at cook position. Let stem return to down position. Thicken
gravy with flour, if desired.
