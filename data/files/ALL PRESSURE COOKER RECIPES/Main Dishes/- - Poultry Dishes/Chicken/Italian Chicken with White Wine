1TBS olive oil
1 med. onion. cut into 1/2 in. thick moons
1 med. red bell pepper, seeded & cut into 1/2 in. thick strips
1 jalapeno chili, seeded & minced (I leave this out)

1/2 C. water
6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs
1/4 tsp. each salt & black pepper
3 TBS chopped fresh cilantro (optional)
8 flour tortillas (warmed)
Salsa of your choice

In 5-7 qt pressure cooker, heat oil over med-high heat. Add onion, 
red pepper,jalapeno, garlic, oregano, & cumin. Cook, stirring often 
until the onion begins to soften, about 2 min. Stir in the water. 
Season chicken with salt & pepper. Add to the pot. Lock the lid in 
place and bring to high pressure. Cook 7 minutes.

Remove the PC from the heat and quick release pressure. Transfer 
the chicken to a cutting board. Coarsely chop the chicken and 
transfer to a serving bowl. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the 
veggies to the bowl. Stir in the cilantro, if desired.

You may boil the cooking liquid in the pot on high heat until 
evaporated to a few TBLS, about 6 min. Stir into the chicken.
Spoon the chicken & veggie mixture into tortillas with salsa and 
roll up.
