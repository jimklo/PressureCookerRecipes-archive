Beer Braised Barbecued Ribs

2 1/2 lbs country style pork ribs
1 onion , sliced
2 cloves garlic minced
1 bay leaf
1 whole clove
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon pepper
1 cup beer
1 1/2 cups barbecue sauce. Use the one you like best or make your own.
1/4 cup Dijon mustard
1/4 cup brown sugar

I did not have any Dijon mustard so I used a small jar of hot and sweet
mustard that came with a gift pack at Xmas and was like Dijon only a
little sweet.

Set Pressure Regulator on #3.
Place ribs in the pressure cooker. Add onion, garlic, seasonings and
beer. Cover and turn Power Level Control to Max. When pressure has been
reached , adjust Power Level Control to #2 and cook 30 minutes. Release
pressure gradually.
ladle out all but about 1/2 cup of the beer and drppings. Remove and
discard bay leaf and clove. Combine barbecue sauce, mustard and sugar
and pour over ribs. Cover and turn power Level Control to max. When
pressure has been reached, adjust Power Level Control to #2 and cook 10
minutes. Release pressure gradually.
Makes 2 to 4 servings.
If I used my on the stove pressure cooker this would have taken a bit
longer to cook because it does not have a pressure regulater gauge. It
is generic...
