8 ounces small onions -- (half 16-ounce bag)
1 medium celery stalk -- cut crosswise into ½-inch pieces

NOTES : Osso Buco usually calls for very thick, can very expensive veal (or
beef) shanks, but we use thinner - and less expensive - veal shoulder arm
steaks. They may be labeled as chops, just be sure to look for the small round
bone.
