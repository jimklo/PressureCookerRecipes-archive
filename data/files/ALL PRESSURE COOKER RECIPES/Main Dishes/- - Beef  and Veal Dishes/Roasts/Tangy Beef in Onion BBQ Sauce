Southwestern Brisket
from Express Cooking cookbook
Makes 8 servings
1 small yellow onion, minced
1 cup tomato sauce
1/4 cup cider vinegar
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/4 cup firmly packed light brown sugar
1/2 tablespoon dry mustard
1 teaspoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon hot paprika
1 teaspoon hot paprika
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon ground cumin
1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric
1 teaspoon mesquite-flavored liquid smoke
1 (2 3/4 to 3 pound) beef brisket, visible fat removed

Combine all the ingredients, except the brisket, in a pressure cooker. Stir
to mix. Add the brisket, spooning sauce over to coat. Cover, lock, and bring
to high pressure over medium-high heat. Reduce the heat to stabilize pressure
and cook for 60 minutes.

Remove the pressure cooker from the heat and let the pressure drop naturally.
Carefully remove the cover and transfer the meat to a cutting board. Over
medium heat, bring the sauce in the cooker to a boil and boil for 5 minutes.
Thinly slice the meat across the grain and return it to the pressure cooker.
Simmer for 5 minutes.

I probably would just use my favorite bottle barbecue sauce.
