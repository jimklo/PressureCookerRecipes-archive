Didn't have all the envelopes of gravy and salad dressing mixes to do Ray's 
recipe, so subbed ....

1 can of cola & water to make up the amount needed to not let the pressure cooker 
run dry (my hubby likes gravy, so I made it up to 3 cups of liquid)

1 envelope of au jus mix
2 Tbsp of Club House Garlic Plus mix
1 Tbsp of Club House Sour Cream & Onion Popcorn Seasoning

Lots of pepper on the roast itself after I browned it. Thickened it up after taking the roast out with a bit of corn starch & water
 
It is the best gravy I ever made!!!!!
 
I over cooked the roast, so the ends of it were more like shredded beef... so I 
sliced it thick, and we will get two good meals out of it... I'm debating on 
whether to make the remnants into a Sheppard's pie or beef dip.
 
Thanks as always for the inspiration Ray
