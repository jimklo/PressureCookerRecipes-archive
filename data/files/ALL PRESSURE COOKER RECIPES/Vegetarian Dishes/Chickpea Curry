Risotto with Winter Squash

Brightly colored butternut squash is a rich source of iron and vitamin C and
adds texture and flavor to simple risotto. Save a ton of time by cooking this
dish in a pressure cooker.

1    tablespoon olive oil
1    cup finely chopped onion
1 1/4    cups Arborio rice
1    teaspoon dried sage
4    cups vegetable broth
1    pound butternut squash, washed, seeded, peeled and diced
1    teaspoon salt
1/4  cup grated Parmesan cheese
2    teaspoons chopped fresh parsley
1/8  teaspoon ground black pepper

Heat olive oil in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Add onions and
cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute. Add rice and sage, stirring until
well blended. Add broth and bring to a boil. Stir in squash and salt.

Close lid and follow manufacturer's instructions to cook risotto on high
pressure for 5 minutes. Allow pressure to come down, remove lid and stir
until smooth and creamy.

Continue cooking over medium heat until rice is tender. Stir in Parmesan
cheese, parsley and pepper.

NOTE: Melons, squash, and cucumbers, all of which ripen while lying on the
ground, can be exposed to salmonella and e. coli bacteria. As a precaution,
they should be washed with soap and hot water, then rinsed before proceeding
with any recipe. This applies even if you are only using the flesh of the
melon (or squash or cucumber); the mere act of cutting through the rind is
enough to bring harmful bacteria in contact with the flesh.
