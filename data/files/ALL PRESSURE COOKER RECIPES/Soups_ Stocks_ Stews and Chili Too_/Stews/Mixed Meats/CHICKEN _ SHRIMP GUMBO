Beef version:

Cube 1-2# of beef, 1" cubes, coat lightly in flour and brown in some
oil in your PC.
Pour in 1 Can of Beef Broth or Beef Consume' & 1 can cream of
mushroom soup, & stir. Add some fresh chopped celery, onions &
carrots, or veggies of choice. A pinch of black pepper, garlic
powder and 1 T of Worsteshire Sauce. Cook for 15 minutes after it
comes to pressure. If you do not have fresh veggies, you can use
canned. If using canned, add it after everything else has cooked and
just mix them in to heat up. Works great. Serve this over mashed
taters, noodles , or rice. Salt & peper to taste.

Chicken or Pork version:

Same as above but use chicken or pork, cream of chicken soup or
cream of celery soup, chicken or vegetable broth, and no worsteshire
sauce. Add a drop extra salt to this if desired since there is no
worsteshire.

We had these 2 meals the past 2 nights, and they werw wonderful. We
just made these recipes up and they came out great. Even the baby
loved it.

Anyone else have quick 20 minute, start to finish meals?
