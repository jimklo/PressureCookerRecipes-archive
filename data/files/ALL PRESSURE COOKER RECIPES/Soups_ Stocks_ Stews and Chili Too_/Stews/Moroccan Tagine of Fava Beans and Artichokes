Moroccan Tagine of Fava Beans and Artichokes

Tagines with fava beans are usually prepared as family meals, but the 
addition of artichoke hearts makes this particular dish elegant enough 
for company. Ginger and preserved lemon give the sauce its robust, tangy 
flavor.

1/2 kg (about 1 lb.) lamb, beef or goat, cut into 3" or 4" pieces
1 medium onion, chopped
3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
1 1/2 teaspoons ginger
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 teaspoon turmeric (or 1/4 teaspoon Moroccan yellow colorant)
1 large handful of fresh cilantro, finely chopped
1 large handful of fresh parsley, finely chopped
1/4 cup olive oil
1/4 cup vegetable oil

1/2 kg (about 1 lb.) shelled fava beans (approx. 3 lb. in the pod)
8 artichoke hearts
1 preserved lemon, quartered and seeds removed
1 large handful of red olives

Mix the meat, onion, garlic, spices, herbs and oils in a pressure 
cooker. Over medium heat, brown the meat, uncovered and stirring 
occasionally, for about 10 minutes.

Add about 2 cups of water, cover the pressure cooker, and increase the 
heat to high. When pressure has been achieved, lower the heat to medium 
to medium-high, and cook with pressure for about 30 minutes.

Add the fava beans, artichoke hearts, lemons and olives. If necessary, 
add enough water so that the artichokes and beans are completely 
submerged when pushed down with a spoon.

Cover the pot and bring to pressure over high heat. Lower the heat to 
medium to medium high, and cook for 10 minutes.

Uncover the pressure cooker, and reduce the sauce over medium heat until 
it is the consistency of a very thick broth and sits well below the 
level of the beans and artichokes.

Serve with crusty bread for scooping up the tagine.

Serves: 4
