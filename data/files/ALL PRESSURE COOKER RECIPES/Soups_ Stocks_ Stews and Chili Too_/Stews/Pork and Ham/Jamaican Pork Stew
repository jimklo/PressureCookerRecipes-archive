Pork, Black Bean and Sweet Potato Stew

Using your pressure cooker this meal will be ready in a matter of minutes, 15
to be exact! Pork, sweet potatoes, beans, brown sugar and mustard all blend
in for a unique taste sensation.

1    cup dried black bean or black-eyed peas, or 1 (15-oz.) can beans,
rinsed, drained
1 1/2    pounds boneless lean pork loin, fat trimmed
1     large onion, sliced
2    teaspoons minced garlic
1    tablespoon olive oil
3/4  cup orange juice
1/2  cup packed light brown sugar
2    tablespoons Dijon-style mustard
3     small sweet potatoes (1 pound), peeled, cut into 1 1/2-in. pieces


Cover beans with 2 inches water in large saucepan and heat to boiling; let
boil,
uncovered, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, cover and set aside for at least
1 hour and up to 4 hours. Drain soaking water and rinse.

Cut pork roast into 6 slices, 1½ to 2 inches thick; cut slices into halves.
Sauté pork, onion, and garlic in oil in pressure cooker over medium heat
until browned, about 10 minutes. Stir in beans and remaining ingredients,
except sweet potatoes.

Close and seal lid; cook 12 minutes at 15 pounds pressure, according to
manufacturer's directions. Immediately cool cooker under cold water and open
lid.

Add sweet potatoes to pressure cooker. Close and seal lid; cook at 15 pounds
pressure until sweet potatoes are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Immediately cool
cooker under cold water and open lid.

NOTE: If using canned beans, omit Step 1 of recipe.
NOTE: Although B.E.A.N. recipes usually call for a specific variety, any
canned or dry-packaged bean variety can be easily substituted for another.
