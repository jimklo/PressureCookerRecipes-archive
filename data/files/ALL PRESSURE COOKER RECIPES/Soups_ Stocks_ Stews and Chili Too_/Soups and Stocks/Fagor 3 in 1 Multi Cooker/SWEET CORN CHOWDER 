SWEET CORN CHOWDER 

Serves 6, Cooking time: 10 minutes + 6 hours

3 cups corn kernels cut from 4 ears of fresh sweet corn (can use frozen
but won't be as sweet)
1 tablespoon butter
1 clove garlic minced
1/2 cup diced red bell pepper
2 cups peeled and diced white potatoes
3/4 cup diced celery
1/3 cup diced onion
2 cup chicken stock
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (or to taste)

Brown the corn in butter using the "browning" setting on the cooker. This
should take about 10 minutes for the corn to turn golden and very sweet.

Change to the slow cooker setting and add the remaining ingredients. Stir 
well.

Cover and cook for 6 hours. Serve with crusty French bread. For a creamy 
version,stir in 1 cup sour cream and serve.
