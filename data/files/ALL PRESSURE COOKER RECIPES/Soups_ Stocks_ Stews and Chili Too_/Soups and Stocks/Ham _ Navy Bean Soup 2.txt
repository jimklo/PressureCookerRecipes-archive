Pressure Cooker Split Pea Soup

1 cup Ham ( this was approximate)
1 small onion chopped
3 carrots sliced
2 med potatoes, chopped somewhat small
1 cup green split peas--rinsed
2 1/2 cups chicken broth (or equiv of chicken broth base and water)

My cooker has a brown / cook feature, so I browned the ham slightly and
added the onion and cooked til onion was translucent.

Add remainder of ingredients to cooker, and stir to mix.

Close lid, make sure that it is sealed well, and locked-- set pressure on
high ,set timer for 15 min according to your cookers directions. Or if you
have a reg. pressure cooker just start timing for 15 min once your cooker
has come up to pressure.

When timer goes off, allow pressure to go down by natural release, though I
have let pressure off by the release valve gradually, and the soup was still
done for me.

Add extra broth if you like thinner soup, and stir well. Add salt and
pepper to taste.

Now was that fast and easy????
