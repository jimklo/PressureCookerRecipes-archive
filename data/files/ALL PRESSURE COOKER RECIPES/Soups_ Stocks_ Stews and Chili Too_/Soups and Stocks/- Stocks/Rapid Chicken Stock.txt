chicken broth for the freezer.

Four (4) chicken carcasses from butcher, $2.00. Plus any scraps from freezer saved for this use.
2-3 stalks of celery
3 large onions with skins. (adds to nice color)
2 carrots

Brown all chicken completely in 425 degree oven. (This step is critical, the browning from the pan etc. is what gives all the flavor.
Add all ingredients to large PC and cover with water.
Bring to pressure and cook for 1 hour.
I then set cooker outside to cool and then remove solidified fat from surface.
Strain all ingredients. Then strain again through a clean cloth.
Put in containers and freeze until needed.

This broth makes yummy gravies, soups, etc.
Freezes well.
