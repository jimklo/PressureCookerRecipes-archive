Postiion 1 56 minutes
Postion 2 30 minutes

Kubys notes: Postion corresponds to pressure 10 or 15.

I traced some parchment paper around a 7 inch springform pan and 
buttered that. I used chocloate gram crackers for the crumbs.

I put the springform pan on a rack in the pressure cooker.

Well.. I didn't have time to put the preserves on. It came out 
GREAT!! I had never made cheesecake before and this was so easy to 
do.
