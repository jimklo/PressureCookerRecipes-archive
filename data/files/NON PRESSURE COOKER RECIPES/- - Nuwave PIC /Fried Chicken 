Fried Chicken using the PIC

Serving size: Serves 6

Ingredients:

1 1/2 pounds bone-in chicken pieces (breasts, thighs, and drumsticks)
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
3 teaspoons poultry seasoning or paprika
3 teaspoons dried basil or marjoram
1 teaspoon garlic powder
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon black or white pepper
7 cups canola or vegetable oil

Directions:

1. Combine flour and all spices in a container you can cover. Shake to 
evenly mix ingredients.

2. Add canola or vegetable oil to 3.5-quart pot.

3. Heat over Medium-High (375 degrees) for 5 minutes, or until toothpick 
fries.

4. Add chicken pieces to seasoned flour, shaking container each time to coat.

5. Cook legs and thighs in oil for 12 minutes per side and breasts for 15 
minutes per side.

6. Cook chicken until internal temperature reaches 170 degrees for breasts, 
and 180 degrees for thighs and drumsticks.

Tips:

Pat meat dry to help coating stick.

Throw out paper towels to prevent cross-contamination.

Be careful not to overcrowd pan. If necessary, cook in two or three batches.

To test if oil is hot enough, drop in a toothpick. If it starts frying, then 
the oil is hot.

Drain on paper towel to remove excess oil (Not shown in video).

This recipe can be altered to fry 4 pounds of chicken. To do so, double the 
dry seasoning and increase flour to 3 cups.

Cut the breasts in half, for a faster cooking time.
