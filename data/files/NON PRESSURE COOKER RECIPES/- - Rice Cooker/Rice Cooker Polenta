Napali Rice Cereal
 
2 1/2 cups jasmine rice or long grain
5 cups coconut milk
2 1/2 teaspoons of salt
2 tablespoons sugar (I use Splenda)
2 1/2 tablespoons cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
 
Place above in rice cooker, press cook.  When it switches to off add the remainder
of the ingredients, stir to mix and cover and let steam for about 5-10 minutes to 
plump the raisins.
 
1/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup raw cashews coarsely chopped
1/4 cup shredded fresh coconut (not the kind in the bag for baking, that usually is full of sugar)

P.S.  Since you haven't used your rice cooker before I wouldn't start with this 
recipe.  Coconut milk doesn't absorb like water and until you are certain your 
particular machine doesn't cook too hot and has the ability to work with many 
other liquids besides water, you might want to start with something using water or
broth.  If you do use this recipe watch the pot to be sure it doesn't scorch.
