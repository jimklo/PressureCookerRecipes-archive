I used the slow cooker function on my Fagor Electric Multi Cooker.  This is so 
very good that I had to share. the recipe is an adaption from Not Your Mother's 
Slow Cooker Recipes for Two.
 
Pork Tenderloin with Raspberry Glaze
 
1 boneless pork tenderloin
1/3 cup raspberry jam (could use any flavor you have.  I have used both red and black raspberry.
2 T. soy sauce
2 T. hoisin sauce
2 T. dry sherry
1 heaping T. grated fresh ginger
1 clove garlic, crushed.
 
Mix everything together except the pork tenderloin and place in a Ziploc bag, then
add the tenderloin and place in the fridge overnight.  I squeezed the bag to make 
sure that the marinade covered the tenderloin.
 
Place tenderloin and marinade in the Multi-Cooker.  Cover.  Set one slow cook for 
7 hours.
 
I served this with layered salad, green beans and small steamed red potatoes.
