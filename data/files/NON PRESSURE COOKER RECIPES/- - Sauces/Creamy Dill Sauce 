Okay, this is my step dad's recipe for coney island sauce he uses at the 
sandwich shop....it would be easy to third it...to five pounds....the chili 
sauce would be 8ounces , the and the first water on the list would be 13 and one
third ounces....the rest would divide down in your head.....2 handfuls etc...
this is also good on a salad with tortillas like a taco salad, I used to eat 
them for lunch when I worked there.....
