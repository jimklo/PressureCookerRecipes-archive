Baked Garlic Cheese Grits from Paula Deen

6 cups chicken broth
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
2 cups regular grits
16 ounces Cheddar, cubed
1/2 cup milk
4 large eggs, beaten
1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
8 ounces grated sharp Cheddar
 

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Grease a 4-quart
casserole dish.
 
Bring the broth, salt, pepper, and garlic powder to a
boil in a 2-quart saucepan. Stir in the grits and
whisk until completely combined. Reduce the heat to
low and simmer until the grits are thick, about 8 to
10 minutes. Add the cubed Cheddar and milk and stir.
Gradually stir in the eggs and butter, stirring until
all are combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared
casserole dish. Sprinkle with the white Cheddar and
bake for 35 to 40 minutes or until set.
