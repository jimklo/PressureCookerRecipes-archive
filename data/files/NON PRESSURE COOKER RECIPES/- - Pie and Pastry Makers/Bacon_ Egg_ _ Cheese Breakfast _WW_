Cooks Essentials mini-pie maker. 

It has 4 pie forms.

They are 2 3/4 inches across at the top (measured from the inside, not the
crimped edge) just over 3/4 inch deep, top is 1/2 inch deep at, rounded, 
center. My Cooks Essentials 4 mini-pie maker manual says 3 Tbsps filling.

Perfect for dessert pies. I often make 2 per person for pot pies or quiches. 
Or, a bunch to set out for a brunch.

I really like mine!

Sunbeam

I have a Sunbeam one which is one of the smaller sized ones.  There is 
about 1/3 cup of filling in a pie, which with the crust is a small meal- 
you probably would want to either eat 2 or something on the side.  the 
Wolfgang Puck one is much larger I think someone said that it can use 
about 3/4 cup of filling I am sure that would be close to pot pie size.

Wolfgang Puck


Yes, it is 1 3/4" deep (that's one and three-quarters inches) and it is 3 1/2" 
in diameter not including the crimping edge part -- just the inside of the top 
of the well.  It seems to hold about 3/4 cup filling.  I cooked 1/2 lb ground 
beef plus about 1/2 cup veggies and some gravy and split equally between the 
two well, it filled both just to the top of the well.  If the filling were such 
that you could mound it up, it would hold almost a cup, I would imagine.
