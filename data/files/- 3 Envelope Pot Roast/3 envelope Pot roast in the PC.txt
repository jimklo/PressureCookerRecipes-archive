3 Envelope Roast

Suggestion I use 1/2 water and 1/2 red wine and its yummy. Or use all water your
choice.

3 pound or so roast (beef or pork) last night I used a chuck roast.
1 envelope of dry Italian salad dressing mix
1 envelope of dry ranch salad dressing mix
1 envelope of dry brown gravy mix
Water - for a pressure cooker 2 cups of liquid, water or red wine or 1 cup of  
water and one cup of wine. For a slow cooker you only need 1/2 cup of liquids.

Please note in a SLOW COOKER you CAN cut in half the dry ingredients if you find it overpowering. In the pressure cooker use the whole envelopes. I prefer the whole envelopes in either method of cooking.

OK here is what you do. Put the water/wine in a measuring cup that is larger then the amount of liquids you are using. Now add and mix all three envelopes of dry salad dressings. Mix until blended completely or as best you can.

Brown the roast (if desired) I love mine browned in the CE 8 qt PC) Add the meat to your cooker.

Pour the water/wine salad dressing mixture over the roast.

Now cook as usual. In the Pressure Cooker I cooked it for 70 minutes and use natural release method.In the slow cooker cook it on high for about 4 hours on low about 8 hours.

This is a YUMMY YUMMY Roast! You will love it. And you can use the liquid for gravy or broth! Let me know if you try it! Ray
