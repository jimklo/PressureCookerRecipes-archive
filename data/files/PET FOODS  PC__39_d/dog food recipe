dog food recipe

Message #20273:

Here is the doggie food 'recipe' that I follow
usually:

1 cup brown or white rice, or barley
1 lb. package ground turkey or chicken
2-3 cups water or broth
2 cups vegetables, usually green beans, peas, diced
carrots, grated sweet potato, winter squash
(mashed),lima beans, spinach,
whatever frozen vegetables I have on hand, often the
mixed vegetables for soup

Stove top PC: stir all together in the cooker, cover,
add pressure gauge, lower heat when pressure is
reached, cook under pressure for time noted in manual
for the type of rice or barley you are using.

Do not add salt! Do not add onions! Sometimes I use
3-4 chicken thighs (no skin) and take the meat off the
bone when the chicken has cooled a little. I then chop
the meat fine.

My dog is a miniature poodle, only 10 pounds. At his
check-up just a few weeks ago, the vet said he was in
excellent health at age 10 years; he has never been sick.
