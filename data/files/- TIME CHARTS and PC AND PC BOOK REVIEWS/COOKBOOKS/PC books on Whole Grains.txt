While fine books, neither of Lorna's books: Whole Grains for Busy People: Fast, 
Flavor-Packed Meals and More for Everyone or Whole Grains Every Day, Every Way 
are pressure cooking cookbooks. She does have a book titled Gr eat Vegetarian
Cooking Under Pressure that does have a few grain recipes, though not many. 

The best book, by far, that I know of for cooking grains in a pressure cooker is 
The New Fast Food: The Veggie Queen Pressure Cooks Whole Food Meals in Less than 
30 MInutes by Jill Nussinow. 

Besides her wonderful recipes using whole grains, there's a section in the book 
called Whole Grain Review where she discusses 15 different grains. The book's 
Cooking Whole Grains Chart covers 22 grains. In my opinion, there is no one who 
knows more about cooking grains in a PC than Jill Nussinow. Of course there's 
much more in the book than recipes for using grains, but grains is what I think 
you were specifically interested in. The book and Jill are great pressure 
cooking resources. If you have a question and e-mail her, she'll respond to 
your question.
