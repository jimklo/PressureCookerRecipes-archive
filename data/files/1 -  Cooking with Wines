TIPS AND TRICKS FROM LEE & OTHERS REGARDING ADDING FILES

First click on the link for the files section at 
the left of the page. 

Then click on Recipes, and then on the folder for the 
type of recipe you are adding. 

At that point you add your recipe by clicking on 
"create text file". A screen will pop up that has a place 
for the file name, description, and then a larger box where 
you can type in your recipe or whatever else you are adding. 

This is where you have to do something a bit different. 
The normal word wrap function in the files section doesn't 
work properly and at the end of the line that you type in you 
have to actually hit enter to go to the next line. The reason 
it's tricky is that it appears to be working while you are doing 
it, but, trust me, it doesn't work! If you forget to hit enter 
(like a carriage return on a typewriter) then the next time 
you go in and look at the file, it will be all on one LONG, LONG
line that you have to scroll across to read. It's pretty hard to 
read this way, and we found that it doesn't print out properly 
this way. 

If you are copying and pasting the recipe from another source, 
you'll have to go in and manually put in the returns at the end 
of the lines or the same thing often happens. Sometimes it doesn't 
though when you are copying and pasting. You just have to 
experiment with it to find what works for you.

Another note: If you want to go back and change something after you 
have entered the file, you have to make a change in the file name in 
order for the change to "take". Usually I just added a period to the 
end of the file name and that did it. I was really confused about it 
at first. I'd make changes, go back and look and it hadn't changed 
at all. It was most frustrating.

NB: PLEASE end all filenames with .txt so that our webtv users 
can open them too! (example: porkchops and sauerkraut.txt)
